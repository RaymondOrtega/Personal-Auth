### lessons learned:
```
I had to be creative on this project, coming up with and idea to practice my skills of woking with EJS, MongoDB, and express. At this point a had a really good understanding on how they all worked together. This made me fell like I could build out the code at once before checking the out come of each part of the code. This was a deep lesson learned i now know in the future to never put this approach into practice because this lead to allot of troubleshooting and i ended up having to start beck form the beginning.
